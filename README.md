# Robotic-Joint-Orientation
Calculates and displays the 3D orientation of a joint in a robotic system relative to another joint of the robot.
The number of joints can be changed, as can the type and magnitude of rotation for each joint. 
The thick lines represent the orientation of the reference joint, the thin lines the orientation of the desired joint.
